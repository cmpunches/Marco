# Marco
An HTTP echo service.

## Usage
Start the service, and point your browser at the port you configured in your startup script.

## Why
I wanted to be able to check proxies I get from HOWDI for header tagging that would be designed
to compromise your identity if you actually used it for anything.  Most of those proxies are honeypots.
